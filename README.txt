A project for me to learn flash game development, using Flashpunk.

I'm still figuring out many of the details, however, I do know this, it will
include spaceships, and it will include robots. I know, I know. I am the most
original! You can bask in my originality, I know I do. And you want to be just like me.
Trust me, you do.

Anyhoo, I am mainly focusing on gameplay mechanics in this version of the game,
rather than complex progressions, and enormous amounts of content. Maybe I'll get
to that in a V2 of this project, but for now there is one player ship, one level,
built of a few (TBD) waves of enemies, of which there are a few, you can collect
a few powerups, and play should last a few minutes before you hit the killscreen.
At which point you will die. Possibly rapidly, or not. High scores should be in effect
to brag and compare against friends. Probably through a Kongregate API. I sure as hell
know I'M not making a high score server or nothin'.

Despite this lack of content, I do hope to make a well polished game with fun
movement and combat, and hopefully, some pretty stupid AI for you to fight.

I really hope you see this game on a website soon, and not never. Because that's
what happened to my last 2 games!
